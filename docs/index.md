% Intro to SE


<br clear=all>

An introduction to software life cycle models; size estimation;
cost and schedule estimation; project management; risk management;
formal technical reviews; analysis, design, coding and testing
methods; configuration management and change control; and software
reliability estimation. Emphasis on large development projects. An
individual project required following good software engineering
practices throughout the semester.

Five considerations influence the design  of this subject:

- Post-covid, many new students may not have worked extensively in teams. Hence, this subject is **team-intensive**.
- Much of recommended SE best practices never make sense till you've had to work with someone else's code. So this subject is **maintenance-based** (i.e. we have to maintain and extend other people's code)
- Computer technology is changing at a rapid rate. Hence it is important to teach **deep fundamentals** rather than merely the minor details of some current language.
-  On the other hand, increasingly, computer education  takes an easy package-based approach. To counter that, this subject will run tutorials to make students **command-line gurus**. 
- There is much [hiring volatility](https://layoffs.fyi/) in the current SE market place (especially in the United States, 
      perhaps due to [changes in interest rates](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Citizens-Bank-Seizing-Capital-Opportunities-Impact-Graphic-May-5.jpeg)
      and uncertainties in the tax code [1](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/4616385-the-bipartisan-tax-bill-contains-a-critical-fix-to-spur-american-innovation/)
      [2](https://www.claconnect.com/en/resources/blogs/manufacturing/senate-blocks-section-174-fix-leaving-taxpayers-dismayed-yet-again)). Hence, newcomers to the market
      need some i**landmark product** to show off their skills.
