<h2 id="what-is-a-license">What is a license?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Describes what you can, and more importantly,
<strong>cannot</strong> do with a piece of software.</li>
<li>A license is a legal document. You <em>can</em> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_license_litigation">will</a>
be sued for violating its terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Licenses matter. They are one of the factors in deciding if you
should use a product [1]</p>

<h2 id="why-licenses">Why licenses?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explicitly describes the rights users have over their software.</li>
<li>Traditional software is copyrighted:
<ul>
<li>You are not allowed to use it unless you pay for it.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to modify it.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to share it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open source software is licensed:
<ul>
<li>You may be allowed to use it for free (what is free?)</li>
<li>You may be allowed to modify it.</li>
<li>You may be allowed to share it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Example: who is to blame if the software causes burns down your
server room?
<ul>
<li>Generally, the software author is not liable for damages, even (and
especially in) open-source software.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="free-software-the-free-as-in-beer-vs.-free-as-in-freedom-debate">Free
Software: The free as in beer vs. free as in freedom debate</h2>
<ul>
<li>Free as in beer: You can use it for free.
<ul>
<li>I buy you a beer, it’s free for you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Free as in speech: You can do whatever you want with it.
<ul>
<li>You are free to say whatever you want (but you may have to pay for
it).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very different rights as an end-user.</li>
<li>The source may be open, but:
<ul>
<li>Can you modify it?</li>
<li>Can you then distribute it?</li>
<li>Can you profit from your modifications?</li>
<li>Can you patent it? (see: patent trolls)</li>
<li>What responsibilities do you bear as a user?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Example: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization">Tivoization</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-is-richard-stallman">Who is Richard Stallman?</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a> is the founder of the <a
href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>.</li>
<li>He is the author of the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GNU General Public
License</a> (GPL).</li>
<li>He is a very controversial figure, but his work has had a profound
impact on the software industry.</li>
<li>Stallman is a strong proponent of free (as in speech) software, and
is very vocal about his opinions.</li>
<li>The FSF has contributed, among other things, to GNU and the
GCC.</li>
<li>If you ever hear someone talking about “GNU/Linux” (as opposed to
merely “Linux”), <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy#Opinions">this</a>
is what they are referring to.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-license-should-i-use">What license should I use?</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://choosealicense.com/">Choose a license</a> is a
great resource for choosing a license.</li>
<li>Generally, the Apache and MIT licenses are very common (and
permissive). If you do not know (or hold opinions), you should use one
of these.
<ul>
<li>The major difference: Apache provides an express grant of patent
rights.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The GPL (and AGPL) are strong copyleft licenses. If you want to
ensure that your software remains open, you should use one of these.
<ul>
<li>The major difference: AGPL requires you to distribute your source
code if you use the software over a network. This avoids the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization">Tivoization</a>
problem.</li>
<li>These are also called “viral” licenses, because they require that
any software that uses GPL software must also be GPL licensed.</li>
<li>The GPL has been used for many popular projects, including the Linux
kernel.</li>
<li>However, companies will avoid your project like the plague if you
use the GPL.
<ul>
<li>Which may be a plus, depending on your philosophy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If a GitHub repository does not have a license, <a
href="https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license">all
rights are reserved and it is NOT free OR open source</a>. You may not
modify or redistribute this code without explicit permission from the
owner.
<ul>
<li>However, this could simply be an oversight. If you want to use the
code, you should contact the owner and ask them to add a license.</li>
<li>GitHub <a href="https://choosealicense.com/no-license/">explains it
well</a>: your options are
<ul>
<li>Ask the maintainers nicely to add a license.</li>
<li>Don’t use the software.</li>
<li>Negotiate a private license (bring your lawyer).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-examples">Some examples</h3>
<h4 id="mit-license"><a
href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT License</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Allows commercial use</li>
<li>Allows modification and distribution</li>
<li>License and copyright notice must be included</li>
</ul>

<li>Does not grant trademark rights</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-philosophy-of-open-source">The philosophy of open
source</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Open source is a philosophy, not a license.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>
is a non-profit organization that promotes open source
software.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
Definition</a> is a set of 10 criteria that a software license must meet
to be considered open source.</p></li>
<li><p>Here are principles for making a project more open-source-ish
(TCCMR):</p>
<ul>
<li>Transparency : everyone can see the decision making process</li>
<li>Collaboration : everyone can effect the decision making process</li>
<li>Community : new comers welcome, no information silos, celebrate
diversity, “training wheels” defined, mentor program, make newbies aware
of transparency and collaboration mechanisms</li>
<li>Meritocracy : Meritocracy encourages participation and appreciates
great ideas no matter where they come from. In order for meritocracy to
work in practice, it is critical to build an inclusive environment.</li>
<li>Release early and often: do what you can so that, as soon as you
can, you get feedback from outside of your group. React to the feedback,
in public. Show change and improvements based on that feedback.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="does-open-source-mean-free">Does open source mean free?</h3>
<ul>
<li>No. Open source software can be sold.</li>
<li>However, it is generally free (as in beer).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> is a
non-profit organization that promotes free software.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free
Software Definition</a> is a set of 4 criteria that a software license
must meet to be considered free software.</li>
<li>The term FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) is often used to refer
to software that is both free and open source.
<ul>
<li>Some people prefer the term FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source
Software) to emphasize the distinction between free as in beer and free
as in speech.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="does-open-source-pay-the-bills">Does open source pay the
bills?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes. Some examples where it works:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a> (but see below)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some examples of where it did NOT work:

<h2 id="parting-thoughts-the-red-hat-controversy-2023">Parting thoughts:
The Red Hat controversy (2023)</h2>
<p><a
href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2023/jun/23/rhel-gpl-analysis/">Full
article</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The Red Hat business model is to sell copies of RHEL under the GPL
along with support for their customers.</li>
<li>The RHEL contract states that it does not intend to contradict the
allowances of the GPL (such as redistributing copies), but Red Hat
reserves the right to cancel that contract if the user does so.</li>
<li>Red Hat also reserves the right to “review” a customer to see how
many copies of RHEL are installed.</li>
<li>Red Hat’s lawyers seem to argue that the GPL does not necessitate an
entity from doing business with another.</li>
<li>Obviously, this is not in the <em>spirit</em> of the GPL–but does it
<em>legally</em> violate it?</li>
<li>Until 2014, CentOS was a free alternative to RHEL, built from the
RHEL “CCS” (Complete, Corresponding Source) tarball. In a sense, it
acted as a check-and-balance for RHEL.</li>
<li>In 2014, Red Hat acquired CentOS, and later used it as a testing
ground for what might possibly be future RHEL code.</li>
<li>In 2020, Red Hat ended CentOS entirely, instead changing it to
CentOS Stream, a rolling-release set of packages related to RHEL.</li>
<li>In 2023, Red Hat announced that the CCS would no longer be available
in any way. While the GPL did not require the CCS to exist (only
customers would have needed to receive the source), it was a good-faith
gesture that Red Hat was not violating the GPL.</li>
</ul>
