# ideas for next time

1. three points when people submit a proj3 (encourages you to work with the proj3 people to get it down)
2. google forms
   - auto assignment of proj3 , judged by time. enter a group number. first come frist serve.
   - regrade requests: what is the reason for the regrade
     - ping student when the grade is changed (set the notifcation option on). 
3. regrade requests: after positing, 5 days to request regrade. whatever the new grade, that is the final grade
4. final exam: can replace lower of the grades.
5. proj2,proj3 half the marks come for the extensions
6. Add "milestones" to project spec as a roadmap. i.e. when talking about proj1, yo say it achieved the folowing milestones in its functionality
   - project2 is a roadmap to achieveing N more milestones (N<=5 per milestome)
   - project3 is a roadmap to achieveing N more milestones (N<=5 per milestone)
7. two midterms.
8. test cases
    - > 20 tests per team mmeber, (ideally 50)
      > nominal **and** off nonimal cases  

## rubric for projects
- new stuff shiuld be in seperate branch to old
- file names in rubric (so we can find things)
- list of thigns u cant find, 24 hours to change. 

## rubric for posters

- your poster had screen snaps of the running system; had a url/QR code to the repo; optionlly (bur preferreed) had a url/QR code to a live demo
- you poster did not have vast amounts of whitespace

- your poster offered "milestones"; 
  - i.e. <= 5  clear ways that proj2 was impressively better than proj1 <===
  - and  <= 5 ways that proj3 could be impressively better than proj2.

- your poster boasts your number of test cases (one group listed 130+, which is really cool since that means you can  make new changes to the system while checking if the old stuff still works)

- you 1 minute pitch has certain features:
  - in the first 15 seconds, we had a very clear understanding of what was going on (so good intro sentence)
  - your pitch metnions what was added since proj1
  - your pitch mentioned the milestones of what could be done for proj3
  - your pitch mentioned your test cases
  - your pitch included a laptop showing the software  running  (not an extensive demo, just a taste of the core functionality)
  - your pitch made the case that your technology stack was interesting (e.g. select this project so you can
    learn about kubernetes)
