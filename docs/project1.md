Your task: look at the past, sell a possible future.

What to hand-in: two posters from two projects.

Where to find projects: look at our 
[corpus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17AdVB6rGsKSf8Ut6gG5RD01IngOLjQvVxFdkSS76cYY/edit?usp=sharing)

Note:

- for 25% of the teams, you will be assigned one of your two projects for project2. 
  - so choose wisely
  - study several projects before you settle on your two projects.
  - I  is estimated that you will have to look at 10 projects before you can do the following.
- If you explore our [corpus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17AdVB6rGsKSf8Ut6gG5RD01IngOLjQvVxFdkSS76cYY/edit?usp=sharing) you will find several projects for which is it not
possible to do the following.

## Rubric for posters

Each poster:

- Is a standard page size
- Uses very small fonts ( text may be as small as 4 to 6 point)
- Is a pdf file
- Does  not have vast amounts of white space
- Has 
  - a screen snaps of the running system; 
  - has a  url/QR code to the repo; 
  - optionally (but preferred) has a url/QR code to a live demo (and how you host that demo is up to you).
- Sells the software:
  - i.e. up to  5  ways that this software (Version i) is better than what was true BEFORE this software was written
- Proposes a better version for version i+1
  - 3 to five implementation milestones, each of which  takes version i+1 to a better place
  - Note that these milestones have to demonstrate a possible implementation plan, with clear goals.
  - Perhaps some milestones will be explored in parallel.
- Boasts your number of test cases (one group listed 130+, which is really cool since that means you can  make new changes to the system while checking if the old stuff still works)

## Ways to lose points:

- Your poster does not have the above features.
- Your poster fails to sell. Specifically:
  - in the first 15 seconds or reading, the poster offers  does not  very clear understanding of what was going on (so good intro sentence)
  - the  poster does not  make a case that this technology stack is interesting (e.g. "select this project so you can
    learn about kubernetes")

## Optionally... 

- If you finish this task early, and you want to get started on project2 early, contact a tutor to get an early grade on your posters.
  - If the vision is impressive, we will give you permission to start early on one of your two projects
- And what is project2 you ask? 
  - In project you, you implement that vision for the future of this software.

## How to fail at this project

- Start late, looking at the corpus.
- Write posters for dull projects
