<h2 id="your-task">Your task</h2>
<p>Extend the project you selected from the last project.</p>
<p>Important notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You goal is to do enough work, and paint a clear vision for the
future, such that someone else wants to use your code for project3</li>
<li>your deliverables here include a 15 minute demo with a tutor where
they will be looking for <strong>significant improvement</strong> in
your current project (compared to what you started with).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-to-hand-in">What to hand in</h2>
<p>One pdf with</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a poster advertising your project (just like the project1 poster)
with the aim to attract some other team to work on this code for
project3.</li>
<li>a link to your project repo. That repo must have the follow
<ul>
<li>Repo is public (not at NCSU)</li>
<li>No keys or passwords in files</li>
<li>New stuff should be in separate branch to old</li>
<li>The repo contains the file names
<ul>
<li>READMME.md (with badges)</li>
<li>.gitignore</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bages have to be ‘real’: i.e. if yu click on them you end up at the
service that generated the (e.g._ 78% of tests passing” badge.</li>
<li>Project shows evidence of parallel work; i.e. merged pull
requests</li>
<li>At least 20 test cases per team member. - test cases include nominal
<strong>and</strong> off-nominal cases (so you are testing for expected
and problematic cases)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A table with <strong>three</strong> columns:
<ul>
<li>Column1 has all the following points shown in the table below PLUS
all the points from the <a
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform">Software
Sustainability Evaluation</a>.</li>
<li>Column2 is your self-assessment. For each items, score yourself zero
(none), one (a litte), two (somewhat), three (a lot).</li>
<li>Column3 is for any links you are adding to support your claim in
column two.</li>
<li>At the top, show the sum of column2,</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="rubric-for-poster">Rubric for poster</h2>
<p>One anti-patterns seen in the prior posters (and don’t let this
happen to you):</p>
<ul>
<li>It was hard to distinguish what existed, right now, in the current
project
<ul>
<li>From the proposed extensions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Your poster:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a standard page size</li>
<li>Uses very small fonts ( text may be as small as 4 to 6 point)</li>
<li>Is a pdf file</li>
<li>Does not have vast amounts of white space</li>
<li>Has
<ul>
<li>a screen snaps of the running system;</li>
<li>has a url/QR code to the repo (to ensure that the QR code of the
poster does not expire, use <a href="https://tiny.cc/">tiny.cc</a> or <a
href="https://golinks.ncsu.edu/">NCSU go links</a></li>
<li>optionally (but preferred) has a url/QR code to a live demo (and how
you host that demo is up to you).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sells the software:
<ul>
<li>i.e. up to 5 ways that this software (Version i) is better than what
was true BEFORE this software was written</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Proposes a better version for version i+1
<ul>
<li>3 to five implementation milestones, each of which takes version i+1
to a better place</li>
<li>Note that these milestones have to demonstrate a possible
implementation plan, with clear goals.</li>
<li>Perhaps some milestones will be explored in parallel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Boasts your number of test cases (one group listed 130+, which is
really cool since that means you can make new changes to the system
while checking if the old stuff still works)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ways-to-lose-points">Ways to lose points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your poster does not have the above features.</li>
<li>Your poster fails to sell. Specifically:
<ul>
<li>in the first 15 seconds or reading, the poster offers does not very
clear understanding of what was going on (so good intro sentence)</li>
<li>the poster does not make a case that this technology stack is
interesting (e.g. “select this project so you can learn about
kubernetes”)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
