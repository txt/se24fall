# ideas for next time

1. three points when people submit a proj3 (encourages you to work with the proj3 people to get it down)
2. google forms
   - auto assignment of proj3 , judged by time. enter a group number. first come frist serve.
   - regrade requests: what is the reason for the regrade
     - ping student when the grade is changed (set the notifcation option on). 
3. regrade requests: after positing, 5 days to request regrade. whatever the new grade, that is the final grade
4. final exam: can replace lower of the grades.
5. proj2,proj3 half the marks come for the extensions
6. Add "milestones" to project spec as a roadmap. i.e. when talking about proj1, yo say it achieved the folowing milestones in its functionality
   - project2 is a roadmap to achieveing N more milestones (N<=5 per milestome)
   - project3 is a roadmap to achieveing N more milestones (N<=5 per milestone)
7. two midterms.
8. test cases
    - > 20 tests per team mmeber, (ideally 50)
      > nominal **and** off nonimal cases

## for essay
